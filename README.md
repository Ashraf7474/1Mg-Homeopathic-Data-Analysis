# 1Mg_Homeopathic_Data_Analysis

# --Introduction--

Analyzed Tata 1mg's Homeopathic products using different user-specific factors. The Tata1mg Homeopathic project aimed to analyze product offerings, pricing, brand specialization, user ratings, and ingredients of homeopathic medicines. An interactive dashboard was created for efficient data visualization. Data was scraped from Tata 1mg Homeopathic using Python libraries BeautifulSoup and pandas. Excel was used for data cleaning, aggregations, and visualization. Power BI was used to create the final dashboard. Data analysis was performed on the extracted dataset.

# --Problem aimed to solve--

The main aim is to analyze the data of 1mg Homeopathic and extract valuable insights that can help us understand the product offerings, pricing, brand specialization, user ratings, and ingredients used in homeopathic medicines

These insights can be used to make informed decisions for opening a new homeopathic medicine store.

# --Data Description--
We possess two CSV files derived from scraping data from Tata 1mg, focusing on homeopathic medicines. These CSV files encompass crucial information such as medicine names, prices, ratings, number of ratings, brand details, ingredients, and key benefits.

# --Methodology--

Our approach involves utilizing BeautifulSoup and Selenium for web scraping Tata 1mg's homeopathic data. Following data extraction, we clean and preprocess using pandas. and create an interactive Power BI dashboard, enabling users to explore and make informed decisions.

# --Phases--

Web Scraping: Collect data from Tata 1MG homeopathic data with the help of a web scraping library BeautifulSoup and  Selenium.

Data Cleaning: Removing irrelevant data and correcting inconsistencies, such as missing values, incorrect data types, or duplicate entries.

Data Transformation: Converting data into a format that is suitable for analysis, such as aggregating or summarizing data, or transforming data into a standard format.

Data Integration: Combining data from multiple sources/files to create a single dataset for analysis.

Data Analysis and Visualization: Create visualizations to explore/analyze the data and identify patterns or trends, and use them finally to create a dynamic dashboard with the help of power bi.

PowerPoint Presentation: Compile the project's findings, methodologies, and dashboard visuals into a concise PowerPoint presentation. This presentation will serve as a medium to effectively communicate the project's results, insights, and potential business implications.
